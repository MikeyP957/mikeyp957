We wanted to create an application that allowed users to create profiles, find friends and share outdoor activities that they mutually enjoyed. Users can access Google maps and search for rock climbing routes by location. We completed this task by continuing to use an Agile framework to organize our project tasks to make incremental change to complete a greater goal. GitHub was used for version control. The app uses google  geocoder API's to connect users queries to access the third party climbing API, Openbeta.io. Users are able to save this climbing data on their profile to show other users what climbs they have climbed or are interested in climbing. The app uses a relational database to store user information including friends, personal information, and climbs saved from the climber API. The user interface was created using React.js. We used React Router DOM to direct users to the various pages and protected routes using OAuth.",contribution:"I was responsible for designing the backend for this app so that users could create accounts, save climbs that they found and connect with other users. I used a relational database to set up the relationships between users, profiles and saved data. The database code was written with node.js and an object relational mapper, Sequelize. I also supported the group by creating API routes, connecting users with their data, searching for information through a third party API, and saving that information to access for future reference. I also worked collaboratively to create the Maps page so that users can search for climbs and filter each climb by difficulty. This task taught me how to implement pagination so that a user is not overwhelmed by an abundance of search results.",icons:[Object(u.jsx)(m.f,{}),"   ",Object(u.jsx)(m.e,{}),"   ",Object(u.jsx)(m.a,{}),"   ",Object(u.jsx)(S.b,{})]},{title:"Covid Germ Pod Profiles",url:"https://hidden-island-12801.herokuapp.com/",image:C,description:"Covid Germ Pod was created collaboratively by a team of 4 of my colleagues and myself.
